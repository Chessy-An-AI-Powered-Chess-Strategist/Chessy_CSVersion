# Project Overview:

Chessy is a fully implimented software created for users to play chess with friends or with bots. This project is being codded for our CSC111 class to show our understanding and mastery in the course content. 

### Objecttive:
To develop a chess engine that utilizes a tree structure to map out possible moves ahead (e.g., depth 4 for four moves ahead) and uses an algorithm to evaluate each move based on board positioning and piece values. 

### Scope:

1. Graphics User Interface: This is what you see on the screen when you play. It's where the chessboard and pieces are displayed, and where you make your moves.
2. Chess Logic Folder: Inside this folder, we wrote the code that controls how the game works. It's like the brain behind the game, making sure the pieces move correctly and following all the rules.
3. Bot Chess Player: We also made a computer player you can play against. It's like having a virtual opponent when you want to practice on your own.


# Timeline (3 Weeks)

## Week 1: Setup and Initial Development
- Setup project environment using the python chess library(temporarly)
- Start developing the tree structure for mapping moves.
## Week 2: Setup software arcitecture and create user interface
- Develop and test the evaluation algorithm.
- Created the User interface
- Integrated the UI with basic tree and fix comoatibilaty issues
## Week 3: Develop chess logic and minimax algorithms
- Develop the logic for each piece in the game
- Impliment the minimax algorithm so the bots can play instead of players
